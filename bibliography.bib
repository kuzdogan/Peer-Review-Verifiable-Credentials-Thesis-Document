@article{Pontille.2015,
 abstract = {Born in the 17th century, journal peer review is an extremely diverse technology, constantly torn between two often incompatible goals: the validation of manuscripts conceived as a collective industrial-like reproducible process performed to assert scientific statements, and the dissemination of articles considered as a means to spur scientific discussion, raising controversies, and civically challenging a state of knowledge. Such a situation is particularly conducive to clarifying the processes of valuation and evaluation in journal peer review. In this article, such processes are considered as specific tests in order to emphasize the uncertain properties of pre-tests manuscripts. On the one hand, evaluation tests are examined at the core of the validation of manuscripts, such as defining the coordination of judging instances (editor-in-chief, editorial committee, outside reviewers) or controlling the modalities of inter-knowledge between reviewers and authors. They are also studied regarding the dissemination of articles, notably through the contemporary conception of a continuing evaluation test termed ``post publication peer review''. On the other hand, valuation tests are both part of the validation of manuscripts, such as the weighting of different judgments of the same manuscript and the tensions that these hierarchies cause, and of the dissemination of articles, such as attention metrics recording the uses of articles. The conclusion sketches out how the articulation of these different tests has recently empowered readers as a new key judging instance for dissemination and for validation, potentially transforming the definition of peers, and thus the whole process of journal peer review.},

@article{Pop.2020,
 abstract = {Nowadays, the adoption of demand response programs is still lagging due to the prosumers' lack of awareness, fear of losing control and privacy of energy data, etc. Programs decentralization, by adopting promising technologies such as blockchain, may bring significant advantages in terms of transparency, openness, improved control, and increased active participation of prosumers. Nevertheless, even though in general the transparency of the public blockchain is a desirable feature in the energy domain, the prosumer energy data is sensitive and rather private, thus, a privacy-preserving solution is required. In this paper, we present a decentralized implementation of demand response programs on top of the public blockchain which deals with the privacy of the prosumer's energy data using zero-knowledge proofs and validates on the blockchain the prosumer's activity inside the program using smart contracts. Prosumer energy data is kept private, while on the blockchain it is stored a zero-knowledge proof that is generated by the prosumer itself allowing the implementation of functions to validate potential deviations from the request and settle prosumer's activity. The solution evaluation results are promising in terms of ensuring the privacy of prosumer energy data stored in the public blockchain and detecting potential data inconsistencies.},

@article{Priem.2012,
 abstract = {Although many observers have advocated the reform of the scholarly publishing system, improvements to functions like peer review have been adopted sluggishly. We argue that this is due to the tight coupling of the journal system: the system's essential functions of archiving, registration, dissemination, and certification are bundled together and siloed into tens of thousands of individual journals. This tight coupling makes it difficult to change any one aspect of the system, choking out innovation. We suggest that the solution is the {\textquotedbl}decoupled journal (DcJ).{\textquotedbl} In this system, the functions are unbundled and performed as services, able to compete for patronage and evolve in response to the market. For instance, a scholar might deposit an article in her institutional repository, have it copyedited and typeset by one company, indexed for search by several others, self-marketed over her own social networks, and peer reviewed by one or more stamping agencies that connect her paper to external reviewers. The DcJ brings publishing out of its current seventeenth-century paradigm, and creates a Web-like environment of loosely joined pieces-a marketplace of tools that, like the Web, evolves quickly in response to new technologies and users' needs. Importantly, this system is able to evolve from the current one, requiring only the continued development of bolt-on services external to the journal, particularly for peer review.},

@inproceedings{R.Mukta.2020,
 abstract = {Sharing credentials could raise privacy concerns. For digital credentials to be widely accepted, there is a need for an end-to-end system that provides (i) secure verification of the participant identities and credentials to increase trust, and (ii) a data minimisation mechanism to reduce the risk of oversharing the credential data. This paper proposes CredChain, a blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) platform architecture that allows secure creation, sharing and verification of credentials. Beyond the verification of identities and credentials, a flexible selective disclosure solution is proposed using redactable signatures. The credentials are managed through a decentralised application/wallet which allows users to store their credential data privately under their full control and re-use as necessary. Our evaluation results show that CredChain architecture is feasible, secure and exhibits the level of performance that is within the expected benchmarks of the well-known blockchain platform, Parity Ethereum.},

@article{Raoult.2020,
 abstract = {The current peer review system is under stress from ever increasing numbers of publications, the proliferation of open-access journals and an apparent difficulty in obtaining high-quality reviews in due time. At its core, this issue may be caused by scientists insufficiently prioritising reviewing. Perhaps this low prioritisation is due to a lack of understanding on how many reviews need to be conducted by researchers to balance the peer review process. I obtained verified peer review data from 142 journals across 12 research fields, for a total of over 300,000 reviews and over 100,000 publications, to determine an estimate of the numbers of reviews required per publication per field. I then used this value in relation to the mean numbers of authors per publication per field to highlight a {\&}lsquo;review ratio{\&}rsquo;: the expected minimum number of publications an author in their field should review to balance their input (publications) into the peer review process. On average, 3.49 {\&}plusmn; 1.45 (SD) reviews were required for each scientific publication, and the estimated review ratio across all fields was 0.74 {\&}plusmn; 0.46 (SD) reviews per paper published per author. Since these are conservative estimates, I recommend scientists aim to conduct at least one review per publication they produce. This should ensure that the peer review system continues to function as intended.},

@article{RossHellauer.2017,
 abstract = {Background: {\textquotedbl}Open peer review{\textquotedbl} (OPR), despite being a major pillar of Open Science, has neither a standardized definition nor an agreed schema of its features and implementations. The literature reflects this, with numerous overlapping and contradictory definitions. While for some the term refers to peer review where the identities of both author and reviewer are disclosed to each other, for others it signifies systems where reviewer reports are published alongside articles. For others it signifies both of these conditions, and for yet others it describes systems where not only {\textquotedbl}invited experts{\textquotedbl} are able to comment. For still others, it includes a variety of combinations of these and other novel methods. Methods: Recognising the absence of a consensus view on what open peer review is, this article undertakes a systematic review of definitions of {\textquotedbl}open peer review{\textquotedbl} or {\textquotedbl}open review{\textquotedbl}, to create a corpus of 122 definitions. These definitions are systematically analysed to build a coherent typology of the various innovations in peer review signified by the term, and hence provide the precise technical definition currently lacking. Results: This quantifiable data yields rich information on the range and extent of differing definitions over time and by broad subject area. Quantifying definitions in this way allows us to accurately portray exactly how ambiguously the phrase {\textquotedbl}open peer review{\textquotedbl} has been used thus far, for the literature offers 22 distinct configurations of seven traits, effectively meaning that there are 22 different definitions of OPR in the literature reviewed. Conclusions: I propose a pragmatic definition of open peer review as an umbrella term for a number of overlapping ways that peer review models can be adapted in line with the aims of Open Science, including making reviewer and author identities open, publishing review reports and enabling greater participation in the peer review process.},

@article{RossHellauer.2017b,
 abstract = {Open peer review (OPR) is a cornerstone of the emergent Open Science agenda. Yet to date no large-scale survey of attitudes towards OPR amongst academic editors, authors, reviewers and publishers has been undertaken. This paper presents the findings of an online survey, conducted for the OpenAIRE2020 project during September and October 2016, that sought to bridge this information gap in order to aid the development of appropriate OPR approaches by providing evidence about attitudes towards and levels of experience with OPR. The results of this cross-disciplinary survey, which received 3,062 full responses, show the majority (60.3{\%}) of respondents to be believe that OPR as a general concept should be mainstream scholarly practice (although attitudes to individual traits varied, and open identities peer review was not generally favoured). Respondents were also in favour of other areas of Open Science, like Open Access (88.2{\%}) and Open Data (80.3{\%}). Among respondents we observed high levels of experience with OPR, with three out of four (76.2{\%}) reporting having taken part in an OPR process as author, reviewer or editor. There were also high levels of support for most of the traits of OPR, particularly open interaction, open reports and final-version commenting. Respondents were against opening reviewer identities to authors, however, with more than half believing it would make peer review worse. Overall satisfaction with the peer review system used by scholarly journals seems to strongly vary across disciplines. Taken together, these findings are very encouraging for OPR's prospects for moving mainstream but indicate that due care must be taken to avoid a {\textquotedbl}one-size fits all{\textquotedbl} solution and to tailor such systems to differing (especially disciplinary) contexts. OPR is an evolving phenomenon and hence future studies are to be encouraged, especially to further explore differences between disciplines and monitor the evolution of attitudes.},

@article{Rothwell.2000,
 abstract = {We aimed to determine the reproducibility of assessments made by independent reviewers of papers submitted for publication to clinical neuroscience journals and abstracts submitted for presentation at clinical neuroscience conferences. We studied two journals in which manuscripts were routinely assessed by two reviewers, and two conferences in which abstracts were routinely scored by multiple reviewers. Agreement between the reviewers as to whether manuscripts should be accepted, revised or rejected was not significantly greater than that expected by chance [kappa = 0.08, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) -0.04 to -0.20] for 179 consecutive papers submitted to Journal A, and was poor (kappa = 0.28, 0.12 to 0. 40) for 116 papers submitted to Journal B. However, editors were very much more likely to publish papers when both reviewers recommended acceptance than when they disagreed or recommended rejection (Journal A, odds ratio = 73, 95{\%} CI = 27 to 200; Journal B, 51, 17 to 155). There was little or no agreement between the reviewers as to the priority (low, medium, or high) for publication (Journal A, kappa = -0.12, 95{\%} CI -0.30 to -0.11; Journal B, kappa = 0.27, 0.01 to 0.53). Abstracts submitted for presentation at the conferences were given a score of 1 (poor) to 6 (excellent) by multiple independent reviewers. For each conference, analysis of variance of the scores given to abstracts revealed that differences between individual abstracts accounted for only 10-20{\%} of the total variance of the scores. Thus, although recommendations made by reviewers have considerable influence on the fate of both papers submitted to journals and abstracts submitted to conferences, agreement between reviewers in clinical neuroscience was little greater than would be expected by chance alone.},

However, existing systems often disclose the identity of the raters, which might deter honest users from submitting reviews out of fear of retaliation from the ratees. While many privacy-preserving reputation systems have been proposed, we observe that none of them is simultaneously truly decentralized, trustless, and suitable for real world usage in, for example, e-commerce applications. In this paper, we present a blockchain based decentralized privacy-preserving reputation system. We demonstrate that our system provides correctness and security while eliminating the need for users to trust any third parties or even fellow users.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To determine the effects of training on the quality of peer review.

DESIGN

Single blind randomised controlled trial with two intervention groups receiving different types of training plus a control group.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS

Reviewers at a general medical journal. Interventions Attendance at a training workshop or reception of a self taught training package focusing on what editors want from reviewers and how to critically appraise randomised controlled trials.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

Quality of reviews of three manuscripts sent to reviewers at four to six monthly intervals, evaluated using the validated review quality instrument; number of deliberate major errors identified; time taken to review the manuscripts; proportion recommending rejection of the manuscripts.

RESULTS

Reviewers in the self taught group scored higher in review quality after training than did the control group (score 2.85 v 2.56; difference 0.29, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.14 to 0.44; P = 0.001), but the difference was not of editorial significance and was not maintained in the long term. Both intervention groups identified significantly more major errors after training than did the control group (3.14 and 2.96 v 2.13; P {\textless} 0.001), and this remained significant after the reviewers' performance at baseline assessment was taken into account. The evidence for benefit of training was no longer apparent on further testing six months after the interventions. Training had no impact on the time taken to review the papers but was associated with an increased likelihood of recommending rejection (92{\%} and 84{\%} v 76{\%}; P = 0.002).

CONCLUSIONS

Short training packages have only a slight impact on the quality of peer review. The value of longer interventions needs to be assessed.},

@article{Scott.2007,
 abstract = {Recent science-policy debates have emphasised a growing role for science in helping to address some of society's most pressing challenges such as global environmental change, caring for the needs of ageing populations, and competitiveness in a global age. Other `relevance' pressures include drives for public accountability, pressure for the `democratisation' of science and demands from industry for usable knowledge. Underlying the question of the social relevance of science is the matter of decision-making and quality control in science, usually via the peer-review process. Peer review plays a central role in many of the key moments in science. It is the main form of decision-making around grant selection, academic publishing and the promotion of individual scientists within universities and research institutions. It also underpins methods used to evaluate scientific institutions. Yet, peer review as currently practised can be narrowly scientific, to the exclusion of other pressing quality criteria relating to social relevance. It is often also controlled and practised by scientists to the exclusion of wider groups that might bring valuable perspectives. This article sets out to examine peer review through the lens of social relevance. It challenges peer review as currently practised and makes some suggestions for ways forward.},

@article{Piwowar.2018,
 abstract = {Despite growing interest in Open Access (OA) to scholarly literature, there is an unmet need for large-scale, up-to-date, and reproducible studies assessing the prevalence and characteristics of OA. We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: (1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, (2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and (3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28{\%} of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45{\%}). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47{\%} of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license. We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18{\%} more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.},

@article{Petchey.2014,
 abstract = {Researchers contribute to the scientific peer review system by providing reviews, and {\textquotedbl}withdraw{\textquotedbl} from it by submitting manuscripts that are subsequently reviewed. So far as we are aware, there has been no quantification of the balance of individual's contributions and withdrawals. We compared the number of reviews provided by individual researchers (i.e., their contribution) to the number required by their submissions (i.e. their withdrawals) in a large and anonymised database provided by the British Ecological Society. The database covered the Journal of Ecology, Journal of Animal Ecology, Journal of Applied Ecology, and Functional Ecology from 2003-2010. The majority of researchers (64{\%}) did not have balanced contributions and withdrawals. Depending on assumptions, 12{\%} to 44{\%} contributed more than twice as much as required; 20{\%} to 52{\%} contributed less than half as much as required. Balance, or lack thereof, varied little in relation to the number of years a researcher had been active (reviewing or submitting). Researchers who contributed less than required did not lack the opportunity to review. Researchers who submitted more were more likely to accept invitations to review. These finding suggest overall that peer review of the four analysed journals is not in crisis, but only due to the favourable balance of over- and under-contributing researchers. These findings are limited to the four journals analysed, and therefore cannot include researcher's other peer review activities, which if included might change the proportions reported. Relatively low effort was required to assemble, check, and analyse the data. Broader analyses of individual researcher's peer review activities would contribute to greater quality, efficiency, and fairness in the peer review system.},

 abstract = {Scientific research activity is reaching a staggering growth rate, introducing new and compounding existing challenges regarding the quality of peer-review, rise of predatory journals, and larger issues involving academic integrity and fraud stemming from the increased pressure to publish. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, is well-suited to address some of the challenges specific to scientific publishing. Companies including ARTiFACTS, Pluto, Orvium, and ScienceMatters-EUREKA, along with academic researchers, are exploring blockchain-based solutions to facilitate research data provenance and workflows, optimize the peer-review process, introduce better incentives, and even create new research journals and platforms utilizing blockchain. Building upon a review of these efforts, we propose a governance framework for scientific publishing based on a consortium blockchain model to create a more efficient means of navigating the publishing process. At the center of this framework is a model that adopts shared governance and validated inclusion via a Democratic Autonomous Organization (DAO). A DAO is an entity wherein the organizational rules are implemented and executed via smart contracts. The DAO will be comprised of participants of validated individuals and organizations who are publishers, editors, peer-reviewers, and citizen scientists to manage and oversee the framework. The framework also maps specifically to the publication workflow of submitting, handling, peer-review, and final editorial decision-making for scientific manuscripts. The goal of this framework is to increase transparency of scientific publishing, create a ``pedigree'' of a manuscript's research life cycle, and democratize the publication process while maintaining the accepted workflow common to scientific publishing by journals.},

In this distributed world IoT device operate not only with the owner of the device but also need to operate with third parties, which leads to have identification for each IoT device. In the coming years, deploying IoT solutions at large scale will have to address complex issues of managing digital identity, security and identity ownership. Most of the current IoT solutions rely upon centralized client-server mechanism for providing connectivity and access to devices and services. However, when billions of devices will begin connecting simultaneously, then existing centralized solution will not suffice. Now days, we rely on federated identities however in this user need to depend on third party as users are not owner of their own identity, this leads to have Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI). In the sequel, there is a need of decentralized method for managing identities in near future. In this chapter, various identification methods are analyzed. Further, Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials are discussed, the discussion focus on whether DID and VC are applicable to the IoT as IoT includes resource constrained devices at base level. It also presents smart home use case utilizing DID and VCs in order to evaluate its applicability. In the same line threat analysis is presented to analyze applicability of the DID and VC for the IoT applications.},

For example, although publication is a critical element in determining the contribution and impact of scientific findings, little research attention has been devoted to the variables operative in journal review policies. In the present study, 75 journal reviewers were asked to referee manuscripts which described identical experimental procedures but which reported positive, negative, mixed, or no results. In addition to showing poor interrater agreement, reviewers were strongly biased against manuscripts which reported results contrary to their theoretical perspective. The implications of these findings for epistemology and the peer review system are briefly addressed.},

Real problems must be properly conceptualized and represented, appropriate techniques for their solution must be constructed, and solutions must be implemented and evaluated using appropriate criteria. If significant progress is to be made, IT research must also develop an understanding of how and why IT systems work or do not work. Such an understanding must tie together natural laws governing IT systems with natural laws governing the environments in which they operate. This paper presents a two dimensional framework for research in information technology. The first dimension is based on broad types of design and natural science research activities: build, evaluate, theorize, and justify. The second dimension is based on broad types of outputs produced by design research: representational constructs, models, methods, and instantiations. We argue that both design science and natural science activities are needed to insure that IT research is both relevant and effective.},

Open scientific practices such as sharing data, materials and analysis scripts alongside published articles have many benefits, including easier replication and extension studies, increased availability of data for theory-building and meta-analysis, and increased possibility of review and collaboration even after a paper has been published. Although modern information technology makes sharing easier than ever before, uptake of open practices had been slow. We suggest this might be in part due to a social dilemma arising from misaligned incentives and propose a specific, concrete mechanism-reviewers withholding comprehensive review-to achieve the goal of creating the expectation of open practices as a matter of scientific principle.},

Using a scientometric approach, this work explores correlations between peer-review measures and bibliometric indicators. In addition, decision trees are used to explore which researchers (according to discipline, academic status and gender) make most of the reviews and which of them accept most of the papers, assuming that these are reasonable proxies for reviewing quality. Results show that there is a weak correlation between bibliometric indicators and peer-review activity. The decision tree analysis suggests that established male academics made the most reviews, while young female scholars are the most demanding reviewers. These results could help editors to select good reviewers as well as opening a new source of data for scientometrics analyses.},

@article{Peffers.2007,
 abstract = {[The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information Systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers h{\^a}ve pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.]},

 abstract = {Peer-review is a necessary and essential quality control step for scientific publications but lacks proper incentives. Indeed, the process, which is very costly in terms of time and intellectual investment, not only is not remunerated by the journals but is also not openly recognized by the academic community as a relevant scientific output for a researcher. Therefore, scientific dissemination is affected in timeliness, quality, and fairness. Here, to solve this issue, we propose a blockchain-based incentive system that rewards scientists for peer-reviewing other scientists' work and that builds up trust and reputation. We designed a privacy-oriented protocol of smart contracts called Ants-Review that allows authors to issue a bounty for open anonymous peer-reviews on Ethereum. If requirements are met, peer-reviews will be accepted and paid by the approver proportionally to their assessed quality. To promote ethical behavior and inclusiveness the system implements a gamified mechanism that allows the whole community to evaluate the peer-reviews and vote for the best ones.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

To see whether telling peer reviewers that their signed reviews of original research papers might be posted on the BMJ's website would affect the quality of their reviews.

DESIGN

Randomised controlled trial.

SETTING

A large international general medical journal based in the United Kingdom.

PARTICIPANTS

541 authors, 471 peer reviewers, and 12 editors.

INTERVENTION

Consecutive eligible papers were randomised either to have the reviewer's signed report made available on the BMJ's website alongside the published paper (intervention group) or to have the report made available only to the author-the BMJ's normal procedure (control group). The intervention was the act of revealing to reviewers-after they had agreed to review but before they undertook their review-that their signed report might appear on the website.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

The main outcome measure was the quality of the reviews, as independently rated on a scale of 1 to 5 using a validated instrument by two editors and the corresponding author. Authors and editors were blind to the intervention group. Authors rated review quality before the fate of their paper had been decided. Additional outcomes were the time taken to complete the review and the reviewer's recommendation regarding publication.

RESULTS

558 manuscripts were randomised, and 471 manuscripts remained after exclusions. Of the 1039 reviewers approached to take part in the study, 568 (55{\%}) declined. Two editors' evaluations of the quality of the peer review were obtained for all 471 manuscripts, with the corresponding author's evaluation obtained for 453. There was no significant difference in review quality between the intervention and control groups (mean difference for editors 0.04, 95{\%} CI -0.09 to 0.17; for authors 0.06, 95{\%} CI -0.09 to 0.20). Any possible difference in favour of the control group was well below the level regarded as editorially significant. Reviewers in the intervention group took significantly longer to review (mean difference 25 minutes, 95{\%} CI 3.0 to 47.0 minutes).

CONCLUSION

Telling peer reviewers that their signed reviews might be available in the public domain on the BMJ's website had no important effect on review quality. Although the possibility of posting reviews online was associated with a high refusal rate among potential peer reviewers and an increase in the amount of time taken to write a review, we believe that the ethical arguments in favour of open peer review more than outweigh these disadvantages.},

@article{vanRooyen.1999,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVES

To examine the effect on peer review of asking reviewers to have their identity revealed to the authors of the paper.

DESIGN

Randomised trial. Consecutive eligible papers were sent to two reviewers who were randomised to have their identity revealed to the authors or to remain anonymous. Editors and authors were blind to the intervention.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES

The quality of the reviews was independently rated by two editors and the corresponding author using a validated instrument. Additional outcomes were the time taken to complete the review and the recommendation regarding publication. A questionnaire survey was undertaken of the authors of a cohort of manuscripts submitted for publication to find out their views on open peer review.

RESULTS

Two editors' assessments were obtained for 113 out of 125 manuscripts, and the corresponding author's assessment was obtained for 105. Reviewers randomised to be asked to be identified were 12{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 0.2{\%} to 24{\%}) more likely to decline to review than reviewers randomised to remain anonymous (35{\%} v 23{\%}). There was no significant difference in quality (scored on a scale of 1 to 5) between anonymous reviewers (3.06 (SD 0.72)) and identified reviewers (3.09 (0.68)) (P=0.68, 95{\%} confidence interval for difference - 0.19 to 0.12), and no significant difference in the recommendation regarding publication or time taken to review the paper. The editors' quality score for reviews (3.05 (SD 0.70)) was significantly higher than that of authors (2.90 (0.87)) (P{\textless}0.005, 95{\%}confidence interval for difference - 0.26 to - 0.03). Most authors were in favour of open peer review.

CONCLUSIONS

Asking reviewers to consent to being identified to the author had no important effect on the quality of the review, the recommendation regarding publication, or the time taken to review, but it significantly increased the likelihood of reviewers declining to review.},

@article{Walker.2015,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}Classical peer review{\textquotedbl} has been subject to intense criticism for slowing down the publication process, bias against specific categories of paper and author, unreliability, inability to detect errors and fraud, unethical practices, and the lack of recognition for unpaid reviewers. This paper surveys innovative forms of peer review that attempt to address these issues. Based on an initial literature review, we construct a sample of 82 channels of scientific communication covering all forms of review identified by the survey, and analyze the review mechanisms used by each channel. We identify two major trends: the rapidly expanding role of preprint servers (e.g., ArXiv) that dispense with traditional peer review altogether, and the growth of {\textquotedbl}non-selective review,{\textquotedbl} focusing on papers' scientific quality rather than their perceived importance and novelty. Other potentially important developments include forms of {\textquotedbl}open review,{\textquotedbl} which remove reviewer anonymity, and interactive review, as well as new mechanisms for post-publication review and out-of-channel reader commentary, especially critical commentary targeting high profile papers. One of the strongest findings of the survey is the persistence of major differences between the peer review processes used by different disciplines. None of these differences is likely to disappear in the foreseeable future. The most likely scenario for the coming years is thus continued diversification, in which different review mechanisms serve different author, reader, and publisher needs. Relatively little is known about the impact of these innovations on the problems they address. These are important questions for future quantitative research.},

@article{Wang.2020,
 abstract = {After introducing key concepts and definitions in the field of digital identity, this paper will investigate the benefits and drawbacks of existing identity systems on the road towards achieving self-sovereign identity. It will explore, in particular, the use of blockchain technology and biometrics as a means to ensure the ``unicity'' and ``singularity'' of identities, and the associated challenges pertaining to the security and confidentiality of personal information. The paper will then propose a model of blockchain-based self-sovereign identity based on attestations, claims, credentials and permissions, which is globally portable across the life of an individual. Such a system is not dependent on any particular government or organization for administration or legitimacy, although it might include government issued identification and biometrics as one of many indicia of identity. Such a solution based on a recorded and signed digital history of actions is a system that best approximates the fluidity and granularity of identity, enabling individuals to express only specific facets of their identity, depending on the parties with whom they wish to interact. This paper focuses on two case studies to explain how such a credentials system could work in specific contexts: (1) Kiva's identity protocol for building credit history in Sierra Leone, and (2) World Food Programme's Building Blocks program for delivering cash aid to refugees in Jordan. Finally, the paper will explore what the future might look like when blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and self-sovereign identity intersect. With digital transactions functioning as identity claims within an ecosystem based on self-sovereign identity, new business models might emerge, such as identity insurance schemes, along with the emergence of value-stable cryptocurrencies (``stablecoins'') functioning as local currencies.},

 abstract = {Open peer review (OPR), where review reports and reviewers' identities are published alongside the articles, represents one of the last aspects of the open science movement to be widely embraced, although its adoption has been growing since the turn of the century. This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of OPR adoption, its early adopters and the implementation approaches used. Current bibliographic databases do not systematically index OPR journals, nor do the OPR journals clearly state their policies on open identities and open reports. Using various methods, we identified 617 OPR journals that published at least one article with open identities or open reports as of 2019 and analyzed their wide-ranging implementations to derive emerging OPR practices. The findings suggest that: (1) there has been a steady growth in OPR adoption since 2001, when 38 journals initially adopted OPR, with more rapid growth since 2017; (2) OPR adoption is most prevalent in medical and scientific disciplines (79.9{\%}); (3) five publishers are responsible for 81{\%} of the identified OPR journals; (4) early adopter publishers have implemented OPR in different ways, resulting in different levels of transparency. Across the variations in OPR implementations, two important factors define the degree of transparency: open identities and open reports. Open identities may include reviewer names and affiliation as well as credentials; open reports may include timestamped review histories consisting of referee reports and author rebuttals or a letter from the editor integrating reviewers' comments. When and where open reports can be accessed are also important factors indicating the OPR transparency level. Publishers of optional OPR journals should add metric data in their annual status reports.},

In addition Libra features an one-time trusted setup that depends only on the size of the input to the circuit and not on the circuit logic. Underlying Libra is a new linear-time algorithm for the prover of the interactive proof protocol by Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum (also known as GKR protocol), as well as an efficient approach to turn the GKR protocol to zero-knowledge using small masking polynomials. Not only does Libra have excellent asymptotics, but it is also efficient in practice. For example, our implementation shows that it takes 200~s to generate a proof for constructing a SHA2-based Merkle tree root on 256 leaves, outperforming all existing zero-knowledge proof systems. Proof size and verification time of Libra are also competitive.},

In this regard, we leverage the smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) algorithms to improve the existing claim identity model in blockchain to realize the identity unlinkability, effectively avoiding the exposure of the ownership of attributes. Furthermore, we implement a system prototype named BZDIMS that includes a challenge-response protocol, which allows users to selectively disclose their ownership of attributes to service providers to protect users' behavior privacy. Performance evaluation and security analysis show that our scheme achieves effective attribute privacy protection and a wider application scope compared with the prior model.},

@article{Zaharie.2018,
 abstract = {Editors of scientific journals meet increasing challenges to find peer reviewers. Rewarding reviewers has been proposed as a solution to incentives peer review, and journals have already started to offer different kinds of rewards, particularly non-monetary ones. However, research so far has mainly explored the efficacy of monetary rewards, while research on non-monetary rewards is barely absent. The goal of this article is to fill this gap by exploring whether and under what conditions a rather common non-monetary reward employed by journals, i.e., to recognize reviewers work by publishing their names on a yearly issue, is effective in increasing the willingness of scientists to become peer reviewers. We test the efficacy of three different reward settings identified in the literature: (1) engagement contingent, (2) task-completion contingent, and (3) performance contingent, through a natural experiment involving 1865 scientists in faculties of business and economics of Romanian universities. We explore whether reward efficacy varies across scientists depending on their gender, academic rank, research productivity, and type of institution to which they are affiliated. The results show that the performance contingency strongly reduces the number of respondents willing to become reviewers (-‚Äâ60‚Äâ{\%} compared to a no-reward setting), particularly males and research productive scientists. Scientists affiliated with private universities are strongly discouraged by the reward. In sum, the results suggest that non-monetary rewards are not necessarily effective, as in some cases they may actually discourage the most intrinsically motivated and competent reviewers.},

@inproceedings{Toth.2020,
 abstract = {Today's web is comprised of a patchwork of identity solutions because neither identity nor privacy were designed-in when it was created. This paper proposes an integrative identity architecture that satisfies the principles of privacy by design from inception. Comprised of identity agents and digital identities that are tightly held by their owners, the architecture decentralizes control over identity from providers to users. Owners can manage their digital identities and private data such that liability risks are reduced for service providers without compromising ease-of-use. Identity agents and digital identities enable owners to prove who they are when required, protect their private and identifying data, and securely collaborate. Digital identities are virtualized to look and behave like credentials found in one's wallet thereby facilitating technology adoption and reducing dependency on remote access passwords. A gestalt privacy by design process has been used to discover and validate the architecture's privacy requirements and design elements, systematically reasoning about how the design satisfies the requirements. The process can be applied to organically improve the architecture and create a reference model for open source development. This paper also relates the architecture to W3C's models for verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers, summarizes the architecture's features, capabilities and benefits, and suggests areas for further study.},

@article{Tite.2007,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Peer reviewers are usually unpaid and their efforts not formally acknowledged. Some journals have difficulty finding appropriate reviewers able to complete timely reviews, resulting in publication delay.

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS

A survey of peer reviewers from five biomedical journals was conducted to determine why reviewers decline to review and their opinions on reviewer incentives. Items were scored on 5-point Likert scales, with low scores indicating low importance or low agreement.

RESULTS

551/890 (62{\%}) reviewers responded. Factors rated most highly in importance for the decision to accept to review a paper included contribution of the paper to subject area (mean 3.67 (standard deviation (SD) 86)), relevance of topic to own work (mean 3.46 (SD 0.99)) and opportunity to learn something new (mean 3.41 (SD 0.96)). The most highly rated factor important in the decision to decline to review was conflict with other workload (mean 4.06 (SD 1.31)). Most respondents agreed that financial incentives would not be effective when time constraints are prohibitive (mean 3.59 (SD 1.01)). However, reviewers agreed that non-financial incentives might encourage reviewers to accept requests to review: free subscription to journal content (mean 3.72 (SD 1.04)), annual acknowledgement on the journal's website (mean 3.64 (SD 0.90)), more feedback about the outcome of the submission (mean 3.62 (SD 0.88)) and quality of the review (mean 3.60 (SD 0.89), and appointment of reviewers to the journal's editorial board (mean 3.57 (SD 0.99)).

CONCLUSION

Reviewers are more likely to accept to review a manuscript when it is relevant to their area of interest. Lack of time is the principal factor in the decision to decline. Reviewing should be formally recognised by academic institutions and journals should acknowledge reviewers' work.},

However, it appears that there are few incentives for researchers to agree to conduct suitable reviews in a timely fashion and in some cases unscrupulous practices are occurring as part of the production of academic research output. Innovations in internet-based technologies mean that there are ways in which some of the challenges can be addressed. In particular, this paper proposes a new currency system using the BlockChain as its basis that provides a number of solutions. Potential benefits and problems of using the technology are discussed in the paper and these will need further investigation should the idea develop further.

We demonstrate that offering material rewards to referees tends to decrease the quality and efficiency of the reviewing process.

We also consider why the natural sciences tend to employ fewer reviewers and have lower rejection rates than do the social sciences. Our two recommendations are that a serious discussion of problems and alternatives to peer review should be started at all levels of psychology and that a science of research communication should be a priority, with psychologists as part of its advance guard because of their relevant substantive and methodological knowledge.},

 abstract = {Identity management solutions are generally designed to facilitate the management of digital identities and operations such as authentication, and have been widely used in real-world applications. In recent years, there have been attempts to introduce blockchain-based identity management solutions, which allow the user to take over control of his/her own identity (i.e. self-sovereign identity). In this paper, we provide an in-depth review of existing blockchain-based identity management papers and patents published between May 2017 and January 2020. Based on the analysis of the literature, we identify potential research gaps and opportunities, which will hopefully help inform future research agenda.},

@book{Tennant.2018,
 abstract = {In 2017, the publication of the G7 Science Communiqu{\'e} set a strong precedent for a global vision where Open Science plays a fundamental role to address current and future global challenges and inequalities1. Education International mirrors this and believes that higher education and research are public services. Despite this, the current scholarly publishing and communication ecosystem is rife with tensions between private and public interests, and at the present is working against the needs and interest of the global scholarly community and wider public. One of the most dominant commercial publishers, Elsevier, a member of the multi-national corporation RELX Group, is among the most controversial actors here with a well-known history of business practices, remarkable among scholarly publishers for having extensive historical criticism from the global research community2. There are growing concerns that Elsevier, among other actors, are becoming very powerful as both publishers and knowledge service providers. Combined with soaring costs to journal subscriptions and services, political activism, extraordinarily high profit margins, and this increasing commercialisation of research infrastructure, Elsevier has positioned itself within a dysfunctional market as a leading actor in the commercialisation of knowledge, research information, and education. In a recent global survey among Education International's affiliates in the further and higher education and research sector, a number of affiliates have pointed to the problematic situation where Elsevier are profiting hugely from publicly-funded research. However, despite widespread criticisms, there is little consensus on the best approach to challenge Elsevier. This report aims to provide the foundations for a critical study into Elsevier's business model and practices and contribute to developing policy objectives relating to open public access to research and educational materials, academic freedom, researcher autonomy, and the scholarly communication system. This research will form a key part of Education International's Global Response campaign on the commercialisation and marketisation in and of education aimed specifically at the further and higher education and research sector.

 abstract = {Scholarly communication is in a perpetual state of disruption. Within this, peer review of research articles remains an essential part of the formal publication process, distinguishing it from virtually all other modes of communication. In the last several years, there has been an explosive wave of innovation in peer review research, platforms, discussions, tools and services. This is largely coupled with the ongoing and parallel evolution of scholarly communication as it adapts to rapidly changing environments, within what is widely considered as the 'open research' or 'open science' movement. Here, we summarise the current ebb and flow around changes to peer review and consider its role in a modern digital research and communications infrastructure and suggest why uptake of new models of peer review appears to have been so low compared to what is often viewed as the 'traditional' method of peer review. Finally, we offer some insight into the potential futures of scholarly peer review and consider what impacts this might have on the broader scholarly research ecosystem. In particular, we focus on the key traits of certification and reputation, moderation and quality control and engagement incentives, and discuss how these interact with socio-technical aspects of peer review and academic culture.},

@article{Tennant.2017,
 abstract = {Peer review of research articles is a core part of our scholarly communication system. In spite of its importance, the status and purpose of peer review is often contested. What is its role in our modern digital research and communications infrastructure? Does it perform to the high standards with which it is generally regarded? Studies of peer review have shown that it is prone to bias and abuse in numerous dimensions, frequently unreliable, and can fail to detect even fraudulent research. With the advent of web technologies, we are now witnessing a phase of innovation and experimentation in our approaches to peer review. These developments prompted us to examine emerging models of peer review from a range of disciplines and venues, and to ask how they might address some of the issues with our current systems of peer review. We examine the functionality of a range of social Web platforms, and compare these with the traits underlying a viable peer review system: quality control, quantified performance metrics as engagement incentives, and certification and reputation. Ideally, any new systems will demonstrate that they out-perform and reduce the biases of existing models as much as possible. We conclude that there is considerable scope for new peer review initiatives to be developed, each with their own potential issues and advantages. We also propose a novel hybrid platform model that could, at least partially, resolve many of the socio-technical issues associated with peer review, and potentially disrupt the entire scholarly communication system. Success for any such development relies on reaching a critical threshold of research community engagement with both the process and the platform, and therefore cannot be achieved without a significant change of incentives in research environments.},

@misc{Tennant.2020c,
 abstract = {Peer review is embedded in the core of our knowledge generation systems, perceived as a method for establishing quality or scholarly legitimacy for research, while also often distributing academic prestige and standing on individuals. Despite its critical importance, it curiously remains poorly understood in a number of dimensions. In order to address this, we have analysed peer review to assess where the major gaps in our theoretical and empirical understanding of it lie. We identify core themes including editorial responsibility, the subjectivity and bias of reviewers, the function and quality of peer review, and the social and epistemic implications of peer review. The high-priority gaps are focused around increased accountability and justification in decision-making processes for editors and developing a deeper, empirical understanding of the social impact of peer review. Addressing this at the bare minimum will require the design of a consensus for a minimal set of standards for what constitutes peer review, and the development of a shared data infrastructure to support this. Such a field requires sustained funding and commitment from publishers and research funders, who both have a commitment to uphold the integrity of the published scholarly record. We use this to present a guide for the future of peer review, and the development of a new research discipline based on the study of peer review.},

@article{Tennant.2016,
 abstract = {Ongoing debates surrounding Open Access to the scholarly literature are multifaceted and complicated by disparate and often polarised viewpoints from engaged stakeholders. At the current stage, Open Access has become such a global issue that it is critical for all involved in scholarly publishing, including policymakers, publishers, research funders, governments, learned societies, librarians, and academic communities, to be well-informed on the history, benefits, and pitfalls of Open Access. In spite of this, there is a general lack of consensus regarding the potential pros and cons of Open Access at multiple levels. This review aims to be a resource for current knowledge on the impacts of Open Access by synthesizing important research in three major areas: academic, economic and societal. While there is clearly much scope for additional research, several key trends are identified, including a broad citation advantage for researchers who publish openly, as well as additional benefits to the non-academic dissemination of their work. The economic impact of Open Access is less well-understood, although it is clear that access to the research literature is key for innovative enterprises, and a range of governmental and non-governmental services. Furthermore, Open Access has the potential to save both publishers and research funders considerable amounts of financial resources, and can provide some economic benefits to traditionally subscription-based journals. The societal impact of Open Access is strong, in particular for advancing citizen science initiatives, and leveling the playing field for researchers in developing countries. Open Access supersedes all potential alternative modes of access to the scholarly literature through enabling unrestricted re-use, and long-term stability independent of financial constraints of traditional publishers that impede knowledge sharing. However, Open Access has the potential to become unsustainable for research communities if high-cost options are allowed to continue to prevail in a widely unregulated scholarly publishing market. Open Access remains only one of the multiple challenges that the scholarly publishing system is currently facing. Yet, it provides one foundation for increasing engagement with researchers regarding ethical standards of publishing and the broader implications of 'Open Research'.},

@article{TenorioFornes.2020,
 abstract = {Science publication and its Peer Review system strongly rely on a few major industry players controlling most journals (e.g. Elsevier), databases (e.g. Scopus) and metrics (e.g. JCR Impact Factor), while keeping most articles behind paywalls. Critics to such system include concerns about fairness, quality, performance, cost, unpaid labor, transparency, and accuracy of the evaluation process. The Open Access movement has tried to provide free access to the published research articles, but most of the aforementioned issues remain. In such context, decentralized technologies such as blockchain offer an opportunity to experiment with new models for science production and dissemination relying on a decentralized infrastructure, aiming to tackle multiple of the current system shortcomings. This paper makes a proposal for an interoperable decentralized system for an open peer review ecosystem, relying on emerging distributed technologies such as blockchain and IPFS. Such system, named ``Decentralized Science'' (DecSci), aims to enable a decentralized reviewer reputation system, which relies on an Open Access by-design infrastructure, together with transparent governance processes. Two prototypes have been implemented: a proof-of-concept prototype to validate DecSci's technological feasibility, and a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) prototype co-designed with journal editors. In addition, three evaluations have been carried out: an exploratory survey to assess interest on the issues tackled, a set of interviews to confirm the main problems for editors, and another set of interviews to validate the MVP prototype. Additionally, the paper discusses the multiple interoperability challenges such proposal faces, including an architecture to tackle them. This work finishes with a review of some of the open challenges that this ambitious proposal may face.},

Over the past few years, blockchain technologies have been inspiring extensive innovations in the transportation field. However, due to the transparency property, sensitive data stored on the blockchain would be accessible to anyone, resulting in a lack of privacy. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and location-aware architecture to address the data integrity along with the privacy-preserving issues in blockchain-based traffic management systems. Our proposed architecture integrates with permissioned and modular blockchain network and non-interactive zero-knowledge range proof (ZKRP) protocol. We develop the prototype system on the Hyperledger Fabric platform and Hyperledger Ursa cryptographic library. The performance results show that our approach is effective and feasible for real-time traffic management while preserving the data privacy requirements.},

In this paper, we conduct an analysis in which we show how open science can benefit from this technology and its properties. For this, we determined the requirements of an open science ecosystem and compared them with the characteristics of BT to prove that the technology suits as an infrastructure. We also review literature and promising blockchain-based projects for open science to describe the current research situation. To this end, we examine the projects in particular for their relevance and contribution to open science and categorize them afterwards according to their primary purpose. Several of them already provide functionalities that can have a positive impact on current research workflows. So, BT offers promising possibilities for its use in science, but why is it then not used on a large-scale in that area? To answer this question, we point out various shortcomings, challenges, unanswered questions, and research potentials that we found in the literature and identified during our analysis. These topics shall serve as starting points for future research to foster the BT for open science and beyond, especially in the long-term.},

 abstract = {In order to increase the value of scientific datasets and improve research outcomes, it is important that only trustworthy data is used. This paper presents mechanisms by which scientists and the organisations they represent can certify the authenticity of characteristics and provenance of any datasets they publish so that secondary users can inspect and gain confidence in the qualities of data they source. By drawing on data models and protocols used to provide self-sovereign ownership of identity and personal data to individuals, we conclude that providing self-sovereignty to data assets offers a viable approach for institutions to certify qualities of their datasets in a cryptography secure manner, and enables secondary data users to efficiently perform verification of the authenticity of such certifications. By building upon emerging standards for decentralized identification and cryptographically verifiable credentials, we envisage an infrastructure of tools being developed to foster adoption of metadata certification schemes, and improving the quality of information provided in support of shared data assets.},

@book{Bartling.2016,
 abstract = {Blockchain technology has the capacity to make digital goods immutable, transparent, externally provable, decentralized, and distributed. Besides the initial experiment or data acquisition, all remaining parts of the research cycle could take place within a blockchain system. Attribution, data, data postprocessing, publication, research evaluation, incentivisation, and research fund distribution would thereby become comprehensible, open (at will) and provable to the external world. Currently, scientists must be trusted to provide a true and useful representation of their research results in their final publication; blockchain would make much larger parts of the research cycle open to scientific self-correction. This bears the potential to be a technical solution to the current reproducibility crisis in science, and could `reduce waste and make more research results true'.

@article{Beck.2018,
 abstract = {Publishing peer review materials alongside research articles promises to make the peer review process more transparent as well as making it easier to recognise these contributions and give credit to peer reviewers. Traditionally, the peer review reports, editors letters and author responses are only shared between the small number of people in those roles prior to publication, but there is a growing interest in making some or all of these materials available. A small number of journals have been publishing peer review materials for some time, others have begun this practice more recently, and significantly more are now considering how they might begin. This article outlines the outcomes from a recent workshop among journals with experience in publishing peer review materials, in which the specific operation of these workflows, and the challenges, were discussed. Here, we provide a draft as to how to represent these materials in the JATS and Crossref data models to facilitate the coordination and discoverability of peer review materials, and seek feedback on these initial recommendations.},

Following a metaphor of ranking algorithms in sports tournaments, we created an index that considers reviewers on different context-specific dimensions, i.e., report delivery time, the length of the report and the alignment of recommendations to editorial decisions. To test the index, we used a dataset of peer review in a multi-disciplinary journal, including 544 reviewers on 606 submissions in six years. Although limited by sample size, the test showed that the index identifies outstanding contributors and weak performing reviewers efficiently. Our index is flexible, contemplates extensions and could be incorporated into available scholarly journal management tools. It can assist editors in rewarding high performing reviewers and managing editorial turnover.},

@article{Bjork.2013,
 abstract = {Publishing in scholarly peer reviewed journals usually entails long delays from submission to publication. In part this is due to the length of the peer review process and in part because of the dominating tradition of publication in issues, earlier a necessity of paper-based publishing, which creates backlogs of manuscripts waiting in line. The delays slow the dissemination of scholarship and can provide a significant burden on the academic careers of authors.

Using a stratified random sample we studied average publishing delays in 2700 papers published in 135 journals sampled from the Scopus citation index. The shortest overall delays occur in science technology and medical (STM) fields and the longest in social science, arts/humanities and business/economics. Business/economics with a delay of 18 months took twice as long as chemistry with a 9 month average delay. Analysis of the variance indicated that by far the largest amount of variance in the time between submission and acceptance was among articles within a journal as compared with journals, disciplines or the size of the journal. For the time between acceptance and publication most of the variation in delay can be accounted for by differences between specific journals.},

However, many valued academic activities are poorly paid or not paid at all. Clearly other factors are at work. Academic motivation and new working patterns are explored using the literature. An anthropological term ?prestige economy? is defined and located as part of a three-part model, and its application to higher education is explored, using a socio-cultural approach rooted in Bourdieu?s analyses of academic life. The implications for those who seek to bring about change in institutions are considered and further research questions outlined.},

This paper presents the state of the art of decentralized identity management using Blockchain and highlights the possible opportunities for adopting the decentralized identity management approaches for future health identity systems. First, we summarize eHealth identity management scenarios. Furthermore, we investigate the existing decentralized identity management solutions and present decentralized identity models. In addition, we discuss the current decentralized identity projects and identify new challenges based on the existing solutions and the limitations when applying it to healthcare as a particular use case.},

 abstract = {To increase transparency in science, some scholarly journals are publishing peer review reports. But it is unclear how this practice affects the peer review process. Here, we examine the effect of publishing peer review reports on referee behavior in five scholarly journals involved in a pilot study at Elsevier. By considering 9,220 submissions and 18,525 reviews from 2010 to 2017, we measured changes both before and during the pilot and found that publishing reports did not significantly compromise referees' willingness to review, recommendations, or turn-around times. Younger and non-academic scholars were more willing to accept to review and provided more positive and objective recommendations. Male referees tended to write more constructive reports during the pilot. Only 8.1{\%} of referees agreed to reveal their identity in the published report. These findings suggest that open peer review does not compromise the process, at least when referees are able to protect their anonymity.},

 abstract = {The number of contributing reviewers often outnumbers the authors of publications. This has led to apathy towards reviewing and the conclusion that the peer-review system is broken. Given the trade-offs between submitting and reviewing manuscripts, reviewers and authors naturally want visibility for their efforts. While study after study has called for revolutionizing publication practices, the current paradigm does not recognize reviewers' time and expertise. We propose the R-index as a simple way to quantify scientists' contributions as reviewers. We modelled its performance using simulations based on real data to show that early-mid career scientists, who complete high-quality reviews of longer manuscripts within their field, can perform as well as leading scientists reviewing only for high-impact journals. By giving citeable academic recognition for reviewing, R-index will encourage more participation with better reviews, regardless of the career stage. Moreover, the R-index will allow editors to exploit scores to manage and improve their review team, and for journals to promote high average scores as signals of a practical and efficient service to authors. Peer-review is a pervasive necessity across disciplines and the simple utility of this missing metric will credit a valuable aspect of academic productivity without having to revolutionize the current peer-review system.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the refereeing procedures at the scientific weekly Nature during and after World War II. In 1939 former editorial assistants L. J. F. Brimble and A. J. V. Gale assumed a joint editorship of Nature. The Brimble-Gale era is now most famous for the editors' unsystematic approach to external refereeing. Although Brimble and Gale did sometimes consult external referees, papers submitted or recommended by scientists whom the pair trusted were often not sent out for further review. Their successor, John Maddox, would also print papers he admired without external refereeing. It was not until 1973 that editor David Davies made external peer review a requirement for publication in Nature. Nature's example shows that as late as the 1960s a journal could be considered scientifically respectable even if its editors were known to eschew systematic external peer review.},

In the event of contractual breaches or aborts, the decentralized blockchain ensures that honest parties obtain commensurate compensation. Existing systems, however, lack transactional privacy. All transactions, including flow of money between pseudonyms and amount transacted, are exposed on the blockchain. We present Hawk, a decentralized smart contract system that does not store financial transactions in the clear on the blockchain, thus retaining transactional privacy from the public's view. A Hawk programmer can write a private smart contract in an intuitive manner without having to implement cryptography, and our compiler automatically generates an efficient cryptographic protocol where contractual parties interact with the blockchain, using cryptographic primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs. To formally define and reason about the security of our protocols, we are the first to formalize the blockchain model of cryptography. The formal modeling is of independent interest. We advocate the community to adopt such a formal model when designing applications atop decentralized blockchains.},

We examined the proportion of review requests that led to a completed review over a 6-year period (2009--2015) in a mid-tier biology journal (Molecular Ecology). We also re-analyzed previously published data from four other mid-tier ecology journals (Functional Ecology, Journal of Ecology, Journal of Animal Ecology, and Journal of Applied Ecology), looking at the same proportion over the period 2003 to 2010. The data from Molecular Ecology showed no significant decrease through time in the proportion of requests that led to a review (proportion in 2009‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.47 (95{\&}nbsp;{\%} CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.43 to 0.52), proportion in 2015‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.44 (95{\&}nbsp;{\%} CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.40 to 0.48)). This proportion did decrease for three of the other ecology journals (changes in proportions from 2003 to 2010‚Äâ=‚Äâ$-$0.10, $-$0.18, and $-$0.09), while the proportion for the fourth (Functional Ecology) stayed roughly constant (change in proportion‚Äâ=‚Äâ$-$0.04). Overall, our data suggest that reviewer agreement rates have probably declined slightly but not to the extent suggested by the anecdotal and rhetorical evidence.},

@phdthesis{Antonino.,
 abstract = {The introduction of renewable energy generation (e.g. solar and wind) in the energy distribution infrastructure makes balancing the total energy load and production in the grid more challenging due to the weather-dependent nature of these energy sources. One approach to mitigate the issue is to use weather forecasts to predict the production and then offer incentives to electric vehicle users (EVUs) to charge their vehicles during the times of energy surplus. However, doing this without leaking sensitive information about the EVUs location and identity presents challenges to the system design. This thesis proposes a privacy-preserving architecture that allows the grid operator to offer incentives for contributing to the grid stability, and to reliably and automatically quantify the extent of each contribution while still maintaining the privacy of the EVUs. Furthermore, the architecture enables decentralised privacy-preserving dispute resolution without leaking any personally identifiable information (PII). The architecture fulfils the goal by utilising self-sovereign identity technologies, such as decentralised identifiers (DIDs), and privacy-preserving digital credentials solutions, such as verifiable credentials (VCs). They allow the solution to utilise ephemeral identifiers and to compartmentalise the information into three different knowledge domains to ensure that only the minimum amount of information needed crosses any domain border. An analysis of the solution indicates that the architecture ensures relatively strong privacy guarantees to the EVUs and solves the grid balancing problem while reducing the number of assumptions to the minimum. This makes the architecture applicable to a wide set of use cases in the EV charging field. Future work includes a detailed performance analysis of a proof-of-concept (PoC), although the information available from related research already indicates relatively low latency and a good level of deployability even on resource-constrained Internet-of-things (IoT) devices.},

@article{Arnold.2019,
 abstract = {Zero-knowledge schemes have recently become a popular attempt to offer users privacy in an attribute-based credential system. In this article, we do not contest the mathematics of these schemes; we assume it is logically sound. Instead, we draw attention to the trade-off that is made when employing cryptography instead of trusted parties to protect user privacy. We assert that, for these approaches to create the trust required by credential verifiers, they must introduce mechanisms that limit their utility and create significant privacy risk to the user that cuts against data minimization goals. Greater trust must be placed in the shelf life of cryptography to prevent the user from being unwantonly correlated than alternative approaches. Just as we would discourage storing encrypted private data on public blockchains, we discourage this approach here. Lastly, this article introduces the concept of a trusted witness which provides privacy for honest users and solves the privacy-trust problem without the disadvantages of the zero-knowledge approach.},

Healthcare service providers prefer to store data about their patients in locked up silos, behind often inadequate layers of security and firewalls. Such an approach results in data breaches and limits the ability to get a holistic view of the medical history of a patient. The obscure cost of treatment is another issue brought to attention recently in media. In this paper, we have proposed a national blockchain framework for managing patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) access control and funds in the context of India's National healthcare scheme. We introduce a transparent insurance claim process for healthcare providers and an auditable trail of EHR access using smart contracts. We use a smart card approach allowing beneficiaries to authenticate their identity using zero-knowledge proofs and delegate access to service the providers via proxy re-encryption.},

 abstract = {Establishing and curating online reputation is becoming more important and inherent in day-to-day life. Until now, a plethora of research has focused on either a) the role of reputation within given (but enclosed) platform environments or b) the general idea of data portability between platforms. However, little scholarly attention has been paid to the question of cross-platform reputation portability. With this work, we introduce reputation portability as one aspect of a broader dialogue on digital identity management. We propose a comprehensive conceptual model, portraying the most important actors, mechanisms, data types, and external influences. By detailing these dimensions, we deduce the need for clear regulatory guidance and identify a large gap in empirical research. Where today's leading platforms currently forgo implementing adequate mechanisms for users, Personal Information Management Systems (PIMS) and blockchain technology may provide means to factually establish reputation portability. To that end, we derive future scenarios, implications and critical assessments for platforms, PIMS, and governing bodies to inform the ongoing debate among researchers and practitioners.},

@article{HorbachS.P.J.M..2017,
 abstract = {Even though integrity is widely considered to be an essential aspect of research, there is an ongoing debate on what actually constitutes research integrity. The understanding of integrity ranges from the minimal, only considering falsification, fabrication and plagiarism, to the maximum, blending into science ethics. Underneath these obvious contrasts, there are more subtle differences that are not as immediately evident. The debate about integrity is usually presented as a single, universal discussion, with shared concerns for researchers, policymakers and 'the public'. In this article, we show that it is not. There are substantial differences between the language of research integrity in the scientific arena and in the public domain. Notably, scientists and policymakers adopt different approaches to research integrity. Scientists tend to present integrity as a virtue that must be kindled, while policy documents and newspapers stress norm enforcement. Rather than performing a conceptual analysis through philosophical reasoning and discussion, we aimed to clarify the discourse of 'scientific integrity' by studying its usage in written documents. To this end, large numbers of scientific publications, policy documents and newspaper articles were analysed by means of scientometric and content analysis techniques. The texts were analysed on their usage of the term 'integrity' and of frequently co-occurring terms and concepts. A comparison was made between the usage in the various media, as well as between different periods in which they were published through co-word analysis, mapping co-occurrence networks of significant terms and themes.},

@misc{HorbachS.P.J.M..2018,
 abstract = {The quality and integrity of the scientific literature have recently become the subject of heated debate. Due to an apparent increase in cases of scientific fraud and irreproducible research, some have claimed science to be in a state of crisis. A key concern in this debate has been the extent to which science is capable of self-regulation. Among various mechanisms, the peer review system in particular is considered an essential gatekeeper of both quality and sometimes even integrity in science. However, the allocation of responsibility for integrity to the peer review system is fairly recent and remains controversial. In addition, peer review currently comes in a wide variety of forms, developed in the expectation they can address specific problems and concerns in science publishing. At present, there is a clear need for a systematic analysis of peer review forms and the concerns underpinning them, especially considering a wave of experimentation fuelled by internet technologies and their promise to improve research integrity and reporting. We describe the emergence of current peer review forms by reviewing the scientific literature on peer review and by adding recent developments based on information from editors and publishers. We analyse the rationale for developing new review forms and discuss how they have been implemented in the current system. Finally, we give a systematisation of the range of discussed peer review forms. We pay detailed attention to the emergence of the expectation that peer review can maintain `the integrity of science's published record', demonstrating that this leads to tensions in the academic debate about the responsibilities and abilities of the peer review system.},

@article{Jefferson.2002,
 abstract = {CONTEXT

Editorial peer review is widely used to select submissions to journals for publication and is presumed to improve their usefulness. Sufficient research on peer review has been published to consider a synthesis of its effects.

METHODS

To examine the evidence of the effects of editorial peer-review processes in biomedical journals, we conducted electronic and full-text searches of private and public databases to June 2000 and corresponded with the World Association of Medical Editors, European Association of Science Editors, Council of Science Editors, and researchers in the field to locate comparative studies assessing the effects of any stage of the peer-review process that made some attempt to control for confounding. Nineteen of 135 identified studies fulfilled our criteria. Because of the diversity of study questions, methods, and outcomes, we did not pool results.

RESULTS

Nine studies considered the effects of concealing reviewer/author identity. Four studies suggested that concealing reviewer or author identity affected review quality (mostly positively); however, methodological limitations make their findings ambiguous, and other studies' results were either negative or inconclusive. One study suggested that a statistical checklist can improve report quality, but another failed to find an effect of publishing another checklist. One study found no evidence that training referees improves performance and another showed increased interrater reliability; both used open designs, making interpretation difficult. Two studies of how journals communicate with reviewers did not demonstrate any effect on review quality. One study failed to show reviewer bias, but the findings may not be generalizable. One nonrandomized study compared the quality of articles published in peer-reviewed vs other journals. Two studies showed that editorial processes make articles more readable and improve the quality of reporting, but the findings may have limited generalizability to other journals.

CONCLUSIONS

Editorial peer review, although widely used, is largely untested and its effects are uncertain.},

@article{Kachewar.2013,
 abstract = {Science is strengthened not by research alone, but by publication of original research articles in international scientific journals that gets read by a global scientific community. Research publication is the 'heart' of a journal and the 'soul' of science - the outcome of collective efforts of authors, editors and reviewers. The publication process involves author-editor interaction for which both of them get credit once the article gets published - the author directly, the editor indirectly. However, the remote reviewer who also plays a key role in the process remains anonymous and largely unrecognised. Many potential reviewers therefore, stay away from this 'highly honorary' task. Appropriate peer review controls quality of an article and thereby ensures quality and integrity of the journal. Recognising and rewarding the role of the reviewer is therefore vital. In this article, we propose a novel idea of Reviewer Index (RI), Reviewer Index Directory (RID) and Global Reviewer Index Directory (GRID), which will strengthen science by focussing on the reviewer, as well as the author. By adopting this innovative Reviewer Centric Approach, a new breed of well-trained reviewers of high quality and sufficient quantity will be available for eternity. Moreover, RI, RID and GRID would also enable grading and ethical rewarding of reviewers.},

However, there are some deficiencies in existing applications related to design, implementation, management and security of digital identities.

 abstract = {Blockchain has received considerable attention recently, due to its promises of verifiable, permanent, and decentralized data handling. In 2017{\&}ndash;2020, blockchain (and associated technologies such as smart contracts) has progressed beyond cryptocurrencies, and has been hailed as a disruptive technology for a score of industries. This study adds to the growing body of research on blockchain adoption and blockchain-driven innovation in various fields, including transport, finance, and education. However, the impact of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) on the management of science has not been systematically studied so far. This paper aims to fill the gap by studying the experience of adoption of blockchain-based solutions in academia in 2017{\&}ndash;2020. The research is based upon a critical review of projects, relevant literature, and qualitative research: interviews (N = 24) and focus groups (N = 4) with startup founders, scholars, university executives, librarians, and IT experts from the European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA), Russia, and Belarus. Key challenges and barriers to blockchain adoption in academia are delineated: usability and security issues, legal concerns, conflict of values, and a critique of political dimensions of blockchain governance.},

 abstract = {The growth in scientific production may threaten the capacity for the scientific community to handle the ever-increasing demand for peer review of scientific publications. There is little evidence regarding the sustainability of the peer-review system and how the scientific community copes with the burden it poses. We used mathematical modeling to estimate the overall quantitative annual demand for peer review and the supply in biomedical research. The modeling was informed by empirical data from various sources in the biomedical domain, including all articles indexed at MEDLINE. We found that for 2015, across a range of scenarios, the supply exceeded by 15{\%} to 249{\%} the demand for reviewers and reviews. However, 20{\%} of the researchers performed 69{\%} to 94{\%} of the reviews. Among researchers actually contributing to peer review, 70{\%} dedicated 1{\%} or less of their research work-time to peer review while 5{\%} dedicated 13{\%} or more of it. An estimated 63.4 million hours were devoted to peer review in 2015, among which 18.9 million hours were provided by the top 5{\%} contributing reviewers. Our results support that the system is sustainable in terms of volume but emphasizes a considerable imbalance in the distribution of the peer-review effort across the scientific community. Finally, various individual interactions between authors, editors and reviewers may reduce to some extent the number of reviewers who are available to editors at any point.},

@article{Lariviere.2015,
 abstract = {The consolidation of the scientific publishing industry has been the topic of much debate within and outside the scientific community, especially in relation to major publishers' high profit margins. However, the share of scientific output published in the journals of these major publishers, as well as its evolution over time and across various disciplines, has not yet been analyzed. This paper provides such analysis, based on 45 million documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period 1973-2013. It shows that in both natural and medical sciences (NMS) and social sciences and humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor {\&} Francis increased their share of the published output, especially since the advent of the digital era (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific publishers account for more than 50{\%} of all papers published in 2013. Disciplines of the social sciences have the highest level of concentration (70{\%} of papers from the top five publishers), while the humanities have remained relatively independent (20{\%} from top five publishers). NMS disciplines are in between, mainly because of the strength of their scientific societies, such as the ACS in chemistry or APS in physics. The paper also examines the migration of journals between small and big publishing houses and explores the effect of publisher change on citation impact. It concludes with a discussion on the economics of scholarly publishing.},

 abstract = {In the last 50 years, there have been many changes to the substance, conduct, and style of research. Many of these changes have proved disastrous to the life of scientists and to science itself. As a consequence, the near-romantic spirit of adventure and exploration that inspired young scientists of my own and earlier generations has become tarnished. Now, many of us feel beleaguered by bureaucrats and by politicians: they affect our lives profoundly, apparently without an understanding of the way discoveries are made or of the nature of science itself. The core purposes of universities, teaching and research, are being eroded by excessive administration. The number and locations of our publications are counted up like beans and the outcomes are used to rank us, one against another; a process of evaluation that has recast the purposes of publication. Applying for grants takes far too much time from a young scientist's life.},

@article{Lee.2017,
 abstract = {There is an increasing push by journals to ensure that data and products related to published papers are shared as part of a cultural move to promote transparency, reproducibility, and trust in the scientific literature. Yet few journals commit to evaluating their effectiveness in implementing reporting standards aimed at meeting those goals ([ 1 ][1], [ 2 ][2]). Similarly, though the vast majority of journals endorse peer review as an approach to ensure trust in the literature, few make their peer review data available to evaluate effectiveness toward achieving concrete measures of quality, including consistency and completeness in meeting reporting standards. Remedying these apparent disconnects is critical for closing the gap between guidance recommendations and actual reporting behavior. We see this as a collective action problem requiring leadership and investment by publishers, who can be incentivized through mechanisms that allow them to manage reputational risk and through continued innovation in journal assessment.The call to open the black box of peer review is decades long, and many concerns raised decades ago ([ 3 ][3]) still resonate: There is too little sound research on journal peer review; this creates a paradox whereby science journals do not apply the rigorous standards they employ in the evaluation of manuscripts to their own peer review practices; as such, a sound research program on journal peer review is needed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of scientific communication. Despite long-standing efforts by the International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publication to foster and showcase such research, it remains difficult to find experimental studies supporting the huge fiscal and personal investment spent on journal peer review ([ 4 ][4]--[ 6 ][5]).Large, systematic experimental studies are needed to evaluate how peer review practices can be optimized to achieve transparency and completeness in reporting---especially for those features introduced to enable others to ``trust, but verify'' that study outcomes have not been selectively introduced, switched, or omitted (e.g., registered reports, open data). We need tests for the effectiveness of different methods for implementing reporting standards into web-based peer review response templates, and of different methods for training authors, reviewers, and editors. We also need to test the effectiveness of adding technologies designed to detect shortcomings in statistical and methodological reporting ([ 7 ][6], [ 8 ][7]), and of the number and expertise of peer reviewers involved (e.g., methodologists versus experimentalists). Such research would require a wealth of journal data (e.g., reviewer scores and commentary, manuscript content) and metadata (e.g., reviewer discipline and expertise)---information too scarcely studied in the meta-research literature, which evaluates scientific practice with an eye toward improving it ([ 9 ][8]).To address the evidence gap in meta-research on journal peer review, we must recognize that the availability of journal peer review data has been constrained by a collective action problem. Science would be better off if journals allowed for and participated in the empirical study and quality assurance of their peer review processes. However, doing so is resource-intensive and comes at considerable risk for individual journals in the form of unfavorable evidence and bad press. Incentives for journals can run against successful implementation of initiatives designed to prevent spinning the results and discussion of a paper based on excavating to find a significant P -value, as papers reporting statistically significant results tend to garner more citations toward a journal's impact factor ([ 10 ][9]). Along these lines, editors and publishers report disregarding their own trial registration requirements for fear of losing ``exciting'' papers to rival journals ([ 11 ][10]).How can editors secure resources to evaluate peer review practices at their journals? Publishers can take an active role. They support the efficiency and integrity of journal peer review by providing staff as well as technological infrastructure such as web-based peer review systems and plagiarism-detecting software (e.g., CrossCheck). Publishers can integrate into their peer review systems ways of measuring or auditing the degree to which accepted and rejected peer reviewed papers meet a journal's reporting standards. More ambitiously, publishers could collaborate with meta-researchers and software designers to create experimental designs and workflows enabling editors and journals to compare competing peer review models and processes. Because journals in the natural, social, and medical sciences have become increasingly consolidated into fewer publishing houses with higher and higher profit margins ([ 12 ][11]), large publishers are comfortably placed to take the lead on creating, licensing, or purchasing such systems. Publishers are also well placed to develop agreements that would license publishers and/or meta-researchers to use reviewer scores and commentary toward programmatic evaluation of the journal's peer review practices ([ 13 ][12]). In the same spirit as the Human Genome Project, which invested 1{\%} of its budget in the Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications research program with enormous payoff, we propose an investment on a similar relative scale to enhance the effectiveness of journal peer review.To incentivize journals to self-assess their peer review practices, they must have opportunities to manage the reputational risk associated with conducting and reporting meta-research. One way to do this would be to broaden the content of reporting guidelines to articulate explicit policy expectations for journal meta-research---and do so in ways that give journals the flexibility to make their own choices about how to balance reputational risk against transparency. For example, the second generation of the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines could add a new category indicating a journal's willingness to facilitate meta-research on the effectiveness of its own peer review practices. To parallel the three-tier structure of the current TOP Guidelines, this meta-research category could be implemented at different levels of stringency. At the lower end of the spectrum, journals could disclose whether they are conducting internal evaluations, where journals maintain the ability to retain study results for internal use. In the mid-range, journals could be required to disclose the results of their internal evaluations, where journals could maintain flexibility about how they present their results for external use (e.g., reporting aggregated results across similar journals to pool risk). At the higher end of the spectrum, journals could relinquish data and analyses to researchers outside the institution for third-party verification---an option that might appeal especially to publishers with fewer resources, as it places the primary financial burden on those conducting the meta-research; alternatively, journals could preregister their experiments in an open-access repository and, once research has been completed, deposit their data set and analyses for public use and verification. This level would be the most open and transparent because it prevents a different kind of selective reporting problem: namely, the failure to report results not favorable to a journal's peer review practices. Adopting any of these levels would signal a journal's commitment to self-assessment and improvement---expectations set by the Committee on Publication Ethics Code of Conduct and Best Practice Guidelines for Journal Editors ([ 14 ][13])---as well as a commitment to reducing research waste and maximizing the value of published research ([ 15 ][14]).What incentives might journals and publishers have for adopting such a framework? Recent changes in publishing, meta-research, and technology have created new challenges and opportunities. With the rise of illegitimate publishers marketing their journals as ``peer reviewed,'' legitimate journals and publishers must find ways to signal the authenticity and effectiveness of their peer review processes. As the call to de-emphasize journal impact factor gains momentum ([ 16 ][15]), alternative indicators have been emerging for evaluating journals along different dimensions of intellectual credibility: for example, by the reproducibility ([ 17 ][16]) or sample size and statistical power of published results ([ 18 ][17]). By undertaking systematic meta-research, publishers and journals would have the opportunity to certify the legitimacy of their peer review practices---as well as identify and advertise ways that they meet or exceed current reporting practices. Such meta-research can help create a new economy of credibility for journals, where it is possible for high-impact journals to score less well on other measures of intellectual credibility ([ 19 ][18]). Until such efforts come to fruition, meta-researchers can further incentivize publishers by shifting their focus to compare reporting practices not by journal ([ 20 ][19]), but by publishing house; and, reviewers can decline to review for journals that neglect to assess their own peer review practices.Publishers have begun investing in technologies designed to interface with journal data and metadata to provide review metrics (e.g., number and role of reviewers) and content (e.g., review commentary) that certify the quality and legitimacy of article-level peer review---see, for example, the American Association for the Advancement of Science's (AAAS) recent acquisition of PRE (Peer Review Evaluation) (AAAS is the publisher of Science ). PRE---and the trend toward making peer review material available alongside published papers (e.g., EMBO Journal )---do a great service by certifying peer review for individual papers. However, they overlook questions facing the broader scientific community about which peer review practices optimize consistency and completeness in reporting. The goal of the framework we propose is to do just this. It requires workflow integrations and meta-research that have visibility into both accepted and rejected papers. Until then, current practices will unnecessarily enable the publication and citation of inadequately reported studies, entrust the integrity of the scientific corpus to a system of post-publication correction that likely focuses disproportionately on the most visible papers ([ 19 ][18]), and leave authors in the crosshairs of highly publicized meta-research studies designed to detect reporting inconsistencies and omissions in published papers. Within the scholarly ecosystem, large publishers are well positioned to undertake such work, not only because of their access to relevant data, but because they are flush at a time when grant agencies and authors are asked to do more with less. Moreover, cultivating a ``reputation of high scholarly values'' is a central part of the profitable business of capturing readers and authors ([ 21 ][20])---a business sustained by reviewers' good-faith, mostly donated efforts.As pressures on journals, publishers, and authors continue to shift, it may be time to apply the ``trust, but verify'' model to journal peer review. Doing so is essential for closing the gap between guidance recommendations and observed reporting behavior. Until then, inadequately reported research will continue to waste time and resources invested by authors, reviewers, journals, academic institutions, funders, study participants, and readers ([ 15 ][14])---and limit the credibility and integrity of science.1.

@incollection{Haustein.2014,
 abstract = {Researchers are used to being evaluated: publications, hiring, tenure and funding decisions are all based on the evaluation of research. Traditionally, this evaluation relied on judgement of peers but, in the light of limited resources and increased bureaucratization of science, peer review is getting more and more replaced or complemented with bibliometric methods. Central to the introduction of bibliometrics in research evaluation was the creation of the Science Citation Index (SCI) in the 1960s, a citation database initially developed for the retrieval of scientific information. Embedded in this database was the Impact Factor, first used as a tool for the selection of journals to cover in the SCI, which then became a synonym for journal quality and academic prestige. Over the last 10 years, this indicator became powerful enough to influence researchers' publication patterns in so far as it became one of the most important criteria to select a publication venue. Regardless of its many flaws as a journal metric and its inadequacy as a predictor of citations on the paper level, it became the go-to indicator of research quality and was used and misused by authors, editors, publishers and research policy makers alike. The h-index, introduced as an indicator of both output and impact combined in one simple number, has experienced a similar fate, mainly due to simplicity and availability. Despite their massive use, these measures are too simple to capture the complexity and multiple dimensions of research output and impact. This chapter provides an overview of bibliometric methods, from the development of citation indexing as a tool for information retrieval to its application in research evaluation, and discusses their misuse and effects on researchers' scholarly communication behavior.},

 abstract = {In this paper we survey a number of interesting applications of blockchain technology not related to cryptocurrencies. As a matter of fact, after an initial period of application to cryptocurrencies and to the financial world, blockchain technology has been successfully exploited in many other different scenarios, where its unique features allowed the definition of innovative and sometimes disruptive solutions. In particular, this paper takes into account the following application scenarios: end-to-end verifiable electronic voting, healthcare records management, identity management systems, access control systems, decentralized notary (with a focus on intellectual property protection) and supply chain management. For each of these, we firstly analyse the problem, the related requirements and the advantages the adoption of blockchain technology might bring. Then, we present a number of relevant solutions proposed in the literature both by academia and companies.},

@article{Eisenstadt.2020,
 abstract = {Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID-19 `Immunity Passport' has been mooted as a way to enable individuals to return back to work. While the quality of antibody testing, the availability of vaccines, and the likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched, we address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving certification for test results and vaccinations. Methods: We developed a prototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture that facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with no other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed for scalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called `Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data platform `Solid', and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our mobile phone app and decentralized server architecture enable the mixture of verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive digital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale linearly in the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is `just another app' which takes only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and decentralized server architecture offer a prototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically, and in effect `waiting in the wings' for the biological issues, plus key ethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.},

 abstract = {Peer review is a process used in the selection of manuscripts for journal publication and proposals for research grant funding. Though widely used, peer review is not without flaws and critics. Performing large-scale experiments to evaluate and test correctives and alternatives is difficult, if not impossible. Thus, many researchers have turned to simulation studies to overcome these difficulties. In the last 10~years this field of research has grown significantly but with only limited attempts to integrate disparate models or build on previous work. Thus, the resulting body of literature consists of a large variety of models, hinging on incompatible assumptions, which have not been compared, and whose predictions have rarely been empirically tested. This scoping review is an attempt to understand the current state of simulation studies of peer review. Based on 46 articles identified through literature searching, we develop a proposed taxonomy of model features that include model type (e.g. formal models vs. ABMs or other) and the type of modeled peer review system (e.g. peer review in grants vs. in journals or other). We classify the models by their features (including some core assumptions) to help distinguish between the modeling approaches. Finally, we summarize the models' findings around six general themes: decision-making, matching submissions/reviewers, editorial strategies; reviewer behaviors, comparisons of alternative peer review systems, and the identification and addressing of biases. We conclude with some open challenges and promising avenues for future modeling work.},

@article{Fox.2017,
 abstract = {Background

It is commonly reported by editors that it has become harder to recruit reviewers for peer review and that this is because individuals are being asked to review too often and are experiencing reviewer fatigue. However, evidence supporting these arguments is largely anecdotal.

Main body

We examine responses of individuals to review invitations for six journals in ecology and evolution. The proportion of invitations that lead to a submitted review has been decreasing steadily over 13~years (2003-2015) for four of the six journals examined, with a cumulative effect that has been quite substantial (average decline from 56{\%} of review invitations generating a review in 2003 to just 37{\%} in 2015). The likelihood that an invitee agrees to review declines significantly with the number of invitations they receive in a year. However, the average number of invitations being sent to prospective reviewers and the proportion of individuals being invited more than once per year has not changed much over these 13~years, despite substantial increases in the total number of review invitations being sent by these journals-the reviewer base has expanded concomitant with this growth in review requests.

Conclusions

The proportion of review invitations that lead to a review being submitted has been declining steadily for four of the six journals examined here, but reviewer fatigue is not likely the primary explanation for this decline.},

We argue that current policy regarding open access publishing, and many of the other proposals for the reform of academic publishing, have been too focused on the opportunities and financial challenges of the most recent changes in digital communications technologies and have given undue weight to commercial concerns.

We show that the business practices and the cultural significance of academic publishing have been significantly transformed since the late nineteenth century as increasing government funding drove the expansion and professionalization of the research community, a process that accelerated rapidly after the Second World War. We examine how academic publishing practices have responded to the increasing number of researchers and publications worldwide, the changing expectations of academic workloads and outputs in the higher education sector, and the new business models in the publishing industry. A key phenomenon has been the growing importance of published works as career-defining tokens of prestige for academics. Although the new technologies that emerged in the late twentieth century offer great potential for improving the speed and efficiency of scholarly communication, the publishing model has been relatively slow to change.},

 abstract = {The success of the Ethereum blockchain as a decentralized application platform with a distributed consensus protocol has made many organizations start to invest into running their business on top of it. Technically, the most impressive feature behind the success of Ethereum is its support for a Turing complete language. On the other hand, the inherent transparency and, consequently, the lack of privacy poses a great challenge for many financial applications. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and present a smart contract for a verifiable sealed-bid auction on the Ethereum blockchain. In a nutshell, initially, the bidders submit homomorphic commitments to their sealed-bids on the contract. Subsequently, they reveal their commitments secretly to the auctioneer via a public key encryption scheme. Then, according to the auction rules, the auctioneer determines and claims the winner of the auction. Finally, we utilize interactive zero-knowledge proof protocols between the smart contract and the auctioneer to verify the correctness of such a claim. The underlying protocol of the proposed smart contract is partially privacy-preserving. To be precise, no information about the losing bids is leaked to the bidders. We provide an analysis of the proposed protocol and the smart contract design, in addition to the estimated gas costs associated with the different transactions.},

 abstract = {In this paper we investigate some properties of zero-knowledge proofs, a notion introduced by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff. We introduce and classify two definitions of zero-knowledge: auxiliary-input zero-knowledge and blackbox-simulation zero-knowledge. We explain why auxiliary-input zero-knowledge is a definition more suitable for cryptographic applications than the original [GMR1] definition. In particular, we show that any protocol solely composed of subprotocols which are auxiliary-input zero-knowledge is itself auxiliary-input zero-knowledge. We show that blackbox-simulation zero-knowledge implies auxiliary-input zero-knowledge (which in turn implies the [GMR1] definition). We argue that all known zero-knowledge proofs are in fact blackbox-simulation zero-knowledge (i.e., we proved zero-knowledge using blackbox-simulation of the verifier). As a result, all known zero-knowledge proof systems are shown to be auxiliary-input zero-knowledge and can be used for cryptographic applications such as those in [GMW2]. We demonstrate the triviality of certain classes of zero-knowledge proof systems, in the sense that only languages in BPP have zero-knowledge proofs of these classes. In particular, we show that any language having a Las Vegas zero-knowledge proof system necessarily belongs to RP. We show that randomness of both the verifier and the prover, and nontriviality of the interaction are essential properties of (nontrivial) auxiliary-input zero-knowledge proofs.},

@article{Grainger.2007,
 abstract = {The peer-review process remains a central part of the value and validity of scientific and technical publishing and proposal assessment. The peer review mechanism has many delicate components that should function most professionally and effectively for best results. An important central tenet is that all who seek to publish should freely avail themselves to review a commensurate load, considering many elements of professional conduct, ethics and responsibility in this process. The review itself should provide timely, unbiased, quality feedback to improve contributions to the system reviewers are serving. An additional component involves follow-on policing of published literature to assert its validity through consensus and validation. This short essay examines our collective duties as contributors, reviewers, and readers to the integrity and safekeeping of this essential quality control process.},

@article{Grimaldo.2018,
 abstract = {This paper examines research on peer review between 1969 and 2015 by looking at records indexed from the Scopus database. Although it is often argued that peer review has been poorly investigated, we found that the number of publications in this field doubled from 2005. A half of this work was indexed as research articles, a third as editorial notes and literature reviews and the rest were book chapters or letters. We identified the most prolific and influential scholars, the most cited publications and the most important journals in the field. Co-authorship network analysis showed that research on peer review is fragmented, with the largest group of co-authors including only 2.1{\%} of the whole community. Co-citation network analysis indicated a fragmented structure also in terms of knowledge. This shows that despite its central role in research, peer review has been examined only through small-scale research projects. Our findings would suggest that there is need to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing across different research communities.},

 abstract = {Due to the widespread COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a push for `immunity passports' and even technical proposals. Although the debate about the medical and ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been less inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes. These schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and vaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes have involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity standards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents that have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the questionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity passports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of `cryptography theater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization. Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-cases like immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity totalitarianism.},

@inproceedings{E.BenSasson.2016,
 abstract = {Bit coin is the first digital currency to see widespread adoption. While payments are conducted between pseudonyms, Bit coin cannot offer strong privacy guarantees: payment transactions are recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which much information can be deduced. Zero coin (Miers et al., IEEE S{\&}P 2013) tackles some of these privacy issues by unlinking transactions from the payment's origin. Yet, it still reveals payments' destinations and amounts, and is limited in functionality. In this paper, we construct a full-fledged ledger-based digital currency with strong privacy guarantees. Our results leverage recent advances in zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). First, we formulate and construct decentralized anonymous payment schemes (DAP schemes). A DAP scheme enables users to directly pay each other privately: the corresponding transaction hides the payment's origin, destination, and transferred amount. We provide formal definitions and proofs of the construction's security. Second, we build Zero cash, a practical instantiation of our DAP scheme construction. In Zero cash, transactions are less than 1 kB and take under 6 ms to verify - orders of magnitude more efficient than the less-anonymous Zero coin and competitive with plain Bit coin.},
