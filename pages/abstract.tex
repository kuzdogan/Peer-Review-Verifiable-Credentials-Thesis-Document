Peer review is an essential part of scientific publishing. Despite the acknowledged importance, it is shown to be far from perfect. Moreover, current ways to assess academic success and reliance on citation-based metrics result in incentives to publish more and review less. The process can be improved by increasing the incentives to review more. Often, reviews are blinded and not published which makes it is difficult to verify if the review took place and to credit the reviewer for the work. Peer review recognition platforms such as Publons act as trusted third parties verifying reviews. Such platforms are becoming the only owners of the worldâ€™s peer review data and publishers are effectively giving away this valuable data for free. 

Recently a specification and data model called Verifiable Credentials became an official W3C recommendation. It is claimed to enable credential exchange in a secure and privacy-preserving way by selective disclosure of claims and zero-knowledge proofs which lets proving a statement without having to share the underlying data. This Design Science Research work is aimed to explore the verification of closed reviews without a trusted third party. The viability of Verifiable Credentials and zero-knowledge proofs will be explored with a system design as the artifact and learnings will be shared.
