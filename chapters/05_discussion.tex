Peer review is a controversial topic in science
many innovations fail
scientific publishing slow to change
too many stakeholders
This work 

First of all, our proposed system require journals to issue peer review credentials. This requirement is a major barrier for adoption as journals must be convinced of the value implementing such a would bring. Besides we assume a very simple peer review process. As discussed, the process varies a lot among journals. Even though the vocabularies are extensible, there need a degree of agreement to mutual vocabularies. Too much extensibility would break the interoperability in practice. 

Who maintains Veriview. What are the incentives? We say its open source and everyone can run veriview. What are the incentives to run in first place? If there are more than one showcasing platforms, then the data is scattered. 

Cold start problem. Bootstrap with existing peer reviews?

More validation of the practical relevance of review verification. and problem of publons. 

The system inherits the advantages of \acrshort{SSI} and \acrshort{VC} systems such as verifiability, selective disclosure... However, the problems of these systems are also inherited. Digital identity is a broader problem . Wallets.

We prefer not to use DLTs.

ok lets recognize reviews, but how? As joao underlines. Nevertheless, there's demand from community and as experiments like ours may reveal better ways
