\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

In this work, we present a design science research on peer review recognition and deliver a system design as an artifact. Our work initially gives an overview of the peer review. We presented the problems discussed in the literature, and highlight the currently misaligned incentives to publish more and get cited more instead of doing peer reviews. Despite being considered highly important and essential in scientific knowledge generation, scientists are not incentivized to do peer reviews and there are concerns on the implications of this on the quality and the sustainability of the peer review. We further investigated the problem and described the lack of recognition for the peer review work of the researchers, and argued that this is partly caused by the nature of the practice of blinded reviewing, that requires identities to be hidden and reviews not to be published. We examined the existing platforms tackling this problem and identified current and future problems from an open science perspective. We observed that these platforms aggregate data by acting as trusted third-party peer review verifiers. From this specific problem we derived our research question:

\begin{center}
    \textit{How can closed peer reviews be verified without trusted third-parties?}
\end{center}

To answer this question we designed and developed a system using \acrlong{VC} and \acrfull{zk-proofs}. The designed system enables the verification of peer reviews through journals that issue peer review credentials. It also includes a review showcasing platform where reviewers can add these verifiable credentials without breaking the anonymity of the blinded reviews. We also implement a proof of concept prototype to show the technical feasibility of the conceptual design.

Our evaluation shows how we fulfil the self-imposed requirements but also demonstrates the need for further validation of our problem.
